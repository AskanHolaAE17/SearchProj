Application make the incoming data searchable.

It is enought to download the application (for example, zip-file),
unpack, bundle it according to Gemfile and run on your machine.

You can enter a part of a word as searching phrase or first name 
and surname (without a middle name).

You can choose preferable option with radio buttons:
like nagative search or search by language type.

Please, use "Приклад" button to get the examples of input for the 
fast interaction with the Searcher.

I used AJAX to show the results of user input and pure JavaScript
to load the search examples into the search field.
